# FUN-PONG
A two-player Arduino game for MLH INIT Day 1

## Inspiration
MLH INIT Day 1 challenge mostly inspired us to build it

## What it does
It is a fun two-player Arduino pong game simulation

## How we built it
Using Tinkercad and in a rush XD

## Challenges we ran into
Building it in under an hour was the greatest challenge

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to finish it on time and then being able to play it

## What we learned
We learned how to create a fun game using simulation in a very short time. We also learned about the human-machine interface because of the components used in the simulation.

## What's next for FUN PONG
Building a real-time hardware breadboard Fun Pong game
